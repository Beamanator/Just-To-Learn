Hi there!

We appreciate you're taking the time to look at our coding challenge. Completing
it shouldn't take you too long, yet we don't think it's trivial. It is all about
implementing a data structure we call a "DictionaryOperation" – the details are
explained inside the source files. We think this is a good opportunity for you
to showcase your abilities, and it should provide us with a good starting point
for technical discussions during the interview.

We've provided stubs for a few different programming languages. Just pick the
one you're most comfortable with and have a go. If your favorite language is not
listed, you're welcome to submit the solution in that language instead (as long
as it's not Forth or something :)).

As you solve the problem, you'll find yourself choosing one design or one
implementation over another. Please put in some comments and let us know why you
chose the way you did. We'd like to hear your thoughts!

Feel free to write in (jobs@culturedcode.com) if you are unsure of anything.

Otherwise, have fun!
