## I didn't make this!!
Original code came from https://codepen.io/Simentesempre/pen/XJovZx

## Some css things I learned:
1. [`backface-visibility`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/backface-visibility)

## Here's how I think the letters work:
1. The `<span>` element gets shaped to a certain size
1. The `:before` and `:after` can be shaped with the border, or just filled in if they're a rectang.e
1. `overflow: hidden` can cut off a particular part of the border so you only see a cornet of it
