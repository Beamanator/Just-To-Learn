# Goal of this project:
Remove standard js comments `'//'` from `manifest.json` file in chrome extensions. This could potentially be used elsewhere too.

# How to use:
Place the `template.js` file (inside template-js directory) wherever is convenient for you. This file will kick off the process to find nearby folders, and files where json comments need to be removed.
