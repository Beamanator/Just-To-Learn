# React Native

Animation systems (modules) inside React Native (ep 5)
- LayoutAnimation
    Easy to setup (very simple)
    Not much control
    Some things might get animated that we don't want to be
- Animated
    More complicated to setup, but much more control
    Probably needed to handle gesture animations

Questions for animation: (ep 6)
    Where is the item on the screen right now? (exact x,y position)
    Where is the element moving to?
    Which element are we moving?
