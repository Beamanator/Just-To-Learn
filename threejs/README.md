## Tutorial series

Some options for tutorials:

-   First I tried: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jP4xpga6yY
    -   Very very basic, intro tutorial
-   Second: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKzyhcyAijo&list=PLRtjMdoYXLf6mvjCmrltvsD0j12ZQDMfE
    -   10 videos, first video has > 100,000 views which makes me think it'll be cool?

It's possible that the best way to learn is just to copy existing examples and try to edit them to your liking?
